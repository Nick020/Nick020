### About me
I am Nicola Arangino, a 20-year-old student from Sardinia, Italy.
I am currently attending a bachelor's degree program specializing in Computer Engineering and pursuing the Automation and Robotics curriculum thereof, at the University of Rome "Tor Vergata". 
In June 2021, I attained my Scientific High School Diploma (in Italian, Diploma di Liceo Scientifico Tradizionale) at "Marconi-Lussu" Senior High School in San Gavino Monreale, Sardinia, Italy.

### How it all started
When I was about 9 years of age, that is to say almost a decade ago, I found out about coding and the powerfulness that came with it. Firstly, I started experimenting with Microsoft-based programming languages, i.e. with VB.NET. After a while, my interest involved other programming languages as well, like C# and Java, I also worked with for a while. But the most surprising and fascinating encounter of my life hitherto has been yet basic Automation with Arduino, which I came to know when I was about thirteen. After that time, I accomplished various electronic and mechanical projects with the platform, also by integrating the latter with other prototyping platforms such as Raspberry PI via Windows 10 IoT Core. Over time, I also approached basic web development via HTML and CSS. After High School graduation, I made my studies out of my passion by deciding to study Computer Engineering, and in particular by pursuing the Automation and Robotics Curriculum. Throughout the said course, I have hitherto developed furthered programming skills in Python and C-like Arduino Programming Language. 
Other passions of mine are also Mathematics, Geometry, Physics and any scientific-related subject, which I see to be strongly intertwined with anything I do pertaining Automation.
